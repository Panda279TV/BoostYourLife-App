# BOOST YOUR LIFE APP

This fictional app was coded with OOP PHP. I already knew some PHP, but this time it was about OOP PHP! The app is all about NLP content. The whole project is in English, but the comments are in German!

This app or code will not be processed any further! If you take all or part of it, please link me! Everything else you will find in the license!

## FIRST STEPS

1) Have a look at the config.php file! Do the Database name, username, password or port matches?

2) Have a another look at the init.php file! Look at the "ROOT_URL" and change it, if necessary!

3) Check in the .htaccess file the RewriteBase, is the folder name correct?

4) For the error handling to work, the .htaccess must be opened and the "Custom error messages/pages" must be revised. There you have to change the folder name if necessary.

5) Import the database file "Boost-Your-Life-Start-Full.sql" into MYSQL/PHPMYADMIN

6) Make an Account at the register.php file or in the Database!

7) When you create a new account, you have no rights. But you can change them in the database at userinfo!

8) Log in with your Account datas and enjoy!

#### WHATS NEXT/ROADMAP

1) Create footer, there is a footer for the home screen

2) A PHP page for the exercises. If you click on an exercise, you will come to this page and there you will see the exercise you clicked on

3) Create a new table in the database that stores the user's exercise history and top exercises

4) The things from point 3 will then be displayed in the home page

5) Create a premium function page

6) Revise the rights even further for the Premium function

7) Make your own App Logo

8) Ajax Post for the Search Page

9)  Ajax Refresh for the Home Page and costumize the Site with more Sliders

10) Rework CSS

11) Making everything more responsive

12) Fill the AGB page with text

13) Customize imprint

14) Adjust data protection
